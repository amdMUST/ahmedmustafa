### Personal Portfolio Site | June 2019

This site will display all my projects. It was written in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

Implemented a light/dark mode using JavaScript which I am very proud of. Also familarized myself with Git by using different branches and merging them just for experience and experimentation. Hosted with GitHub pages.
